Getting started: 
    preflight script calls python3 ../../wsgi, which breaks things. Since I believe 
    the grader will call apachectl start, this line is unnecessary.

Creating Users:
    Can create roles besides the specified 2. While this would be useful, it 
    also allows typos to affect a user's ability to access needed pages. For 
    instance, someone who has difficulty getting the i's in the right places 
    in facilities could prevent a user from being able to approve requests. 
    Not hugely relevant, of course, since we're getting rid of the page and 
    using clients instead.
    
Login:
    Works as described.
    
Add 2 Facilities:
    Your error page made me laugh, thank you.
    Works as advertised, and fails as advertised as well.
    
Add 2 Assets:
    The button on your Add Assets page says 'Add Facility'. Also, page 
    doesn't display a list of assets already in inventory.
    However, everything you described happening happens perfectly.
    
Complete Asset Transfer:
    Works exactly as advertised(and the different-colored updates 
    stating what happened are a great idea). 
    Assets can have load/unload times set before their approval, 
    and can have unload time set before load time, which would play 
    merry heck with the reporting system. Speaking of which...
    
Complete Asset Report:
    Works as described; however, I am fairly certain that this is 
    supposed to display facilities so that a general report(all facilities)
    will still show what asset is at what location. The report also doesn't 
    take into account transfers changing an asset's location.
    
Complete Transfer Report:
    Works as described, except in cases where either due to error or malign intent, 
    the load date is after the unload date.
